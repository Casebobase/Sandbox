<h1><p>Top five centers in history</p></h1>







<h2><center>1. Shaquille O'neal</center></h2>
<p>Shaquille O’Neal, one of the most dominant centers in NBA history, played 19 seasons (1992–2011) with the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. He finished his career with averages of 23.7 points, 10.9 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 2.3 blocks per game, while shooting an incredible 58.2% from the field. Standing at 7’1” and 325 pounds, Shaq overpowered opponents with his sheer size, strength, and agility. He won four NBA championships (2000, 2001, 2002, 2006), earning three Finals MVPs during the Lakers' three-peat alongside Kobe Bryant. Shaq was a 15-time All-Star, 14-time All-NBA selection, and the 2000 NBA MVP, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest big men ever.

He retired with over 28,000 career points and 13,000 rebounds*, ranking among the all-time leaders in both categories. O’Neal was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016 and remains a larger-than-life personality in the basketball world.</p>

He was the cornerstone of the Celtics' dynasty, excelling in clutch moments and redefining the center position with his defensive prowess.

Inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1975, Russell's impact on and off the court remains legendary.
