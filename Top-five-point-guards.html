<p><h1>Top  five point guards in history</h1></p>

	    <h2><center>1. Earvin "Magic" johnson</center></h2>

		The reason I put Magic Johnson at number one for point guard is because he has won five championships with the LA Lakers. Three NBA MVP's three finals MVP's. 17,707 carrer points 10,141 career assists and 6,559 rebounds. Magic averaged 11.2 assists per game in his whole career and 19.5 points per game. And he has never left the LA lakers. Magic was definatley on of the best ever.</p>

		<h2><center>2. Steph Curry</center></h2>

		      <h2><center>3. Oscar robertson</center></h2>

		      Known as the "big o" oscar robertson has been one of the most dominant players to ever play the sport. People may argue that he isn't in the top 3 conversation for point guards because he had one of the best centers ever Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Although he has only won one NBA champioship He has averaged 25.7 points per game 9.5 assists per game almost averging a double double. The big o did play awhile back but he is one of the best point guards ever. </p>

<h2><center>4. Isiah Thomas</center></h2>

	<p> In the first round and the 2nd pick the pistons selected the greatest player in there franchise history, Isiah thomas went to Indianna for college but thats not were he shined the most. A 12 time allstar and a 2 time Allstar MVP. Isiah is a 2 time NBA champion winning them back to back with Dennis Rodman and Joe Dumars.but what if isiah never played, history could have changed majorly how many championships more would have jordan and scottie won.  Isiah averaged 19.2 points per game and 9.3 assists ending his career in 1994. only not starting 8 games in his whole carrer it is clear that he is one of the best. </p>

<h2><center>5. John Stocton</center></h2>

	 is widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, known for his exceptional passing and defensive abilities. Over a 19-year career, all spent with the Utah Jazz, he totaled 19,711 assists (the most in NBA history) and 3,265 steals (second all-time). Stockton averaged 13.1 points, 10.5 assists, and 2.2 steals per game while maintaining a career assist-to-turnover ratio of nearly 3:1. He was a 10-time NBA All-Star and led the league in assists for nine consecutive seasons. Stockton was also known for his durability, playing 1,504 games without ever missing one due to injury. His contributions helped the Jazz reach two NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, though they fell short both times.</p>
